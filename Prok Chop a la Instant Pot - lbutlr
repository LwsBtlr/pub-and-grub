# Instant pot pork chops

## INGREDIENTS

* 2 pork chops, boneless 1″ thick
* 1 tbs butter
* 1 cup chicken broth
* 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
* 1 teaspoon Liquid Smoke

### Rub
* 2 tablespoons brown sugar
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon black pepper
* 1 teaspoon paprika
* 1/2 teaspoon onion powder

## INSTRUCTIONS

1. Mix rub ingredients and rub into both sides of pork chops.
1. Set Instant Pot on sauté (high) and add butter. Once hot, add pork chops and brown on both sides for 1-2 minutes each. Remove pork chops and set aside.
1. Cancel the sauté
1. Add broth and use a wooden spoon to deglaze the bits off the bottom of the pot. 
4. Add Worcestershire sauce and liquid smoke and add pork chops directly to the pot in the liquid.
1. Pressure cook (manual/high) for 7 minutes.

6. Allow a 'natural' release for 12 minutes then quick release and remove chops.
7. Rest for about 5 minutes before serving.

## NOTES 

* For best results it is recommended to use brined pork chops. Packaging will usually indicate that the pork chops contain a solution (usually 12%) to maintain moisture and tenderness.
* If your pork chops aren’t pre-brined as described above, it is highly recommended to use a simple brine: A solution of 1/4 cup (4 tablespoons) salt to 1 quart (4 cups) of water. Lay the pork chops (or other thin cut) in a single layer in a shallow dish and then pour the brine over top. Let this sit for anywhere from 1/2 hour to 2 hours before cooking. (thanks to reader Jack P.)
* I usually add some minced garlic or garlic powder to the rub, but I add garlic to most everything.
